Before is taken 17/11/2017 and After is 15/7/2018. 

With approximately 4 months of varying heights of water inundation and having just suffered heavy frost, the growth shown is why Vetiver is extremely effective in the field and much faster than plants like Lomandra or other native grasses in full sun locations. There is no fertiliser or nutrient provided.
